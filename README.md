# Logistic Regression: Credit Risk Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on using Logistic Regression to predict credit risk based on a given dataset. The goal is to classify customers into two categories: low or high credit risk, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

Project Structure

Notebook: logisticRegression-CreditRisk.ipynb
The Jupyter notebook contains the full implementation of the logistic regression model for credit risk classification, along with data exploration, pre-processing, and evaluation metrics.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features about customers, such as:

1)Age
2)Income
3)Loan Amount
4)Credit History
And more...

The target variable is credit risk, which is classified into binary categories: "Good" or "Bad."

Steps Involved

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of features
Correlation analysis
Model Building
Implementation of Logistic Regression
Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve

Results

The model was evaluated based on various metrics to ensure a balanced approach to identifying both good and bad credit risks. The results show reasonable accuracy and well-balanced precision and recall for both classes.

Conclusion

Logistic Regression proved to be an effective model for predicting credit risk, allowing financial institutions to make data-driven decisions in their lending processes. Further improvements can be explored using more advanced models or hyperparameter tuning.
